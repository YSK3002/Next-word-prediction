# Next-word-prediction

This project implements a machine learning model for predicting the next word in a sentence, demonstrating the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Utilizing preprocessed text data, the project involves tokenization, sequence generation, and training of a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, such as LSTM, to achieve effective predictions. The notebook provides a detailed workflow, including data preparation, model training, and evaluation. It is an excellent resource for understanding predictive text generation and can be extended for use in chatbots, typing assistants, or other language modeling applications.
